This is my first project. Going to create the google homepage.
10/5/2020 recentered elements horizontally using:  
display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding-bottom: 10px; 
And then aligned them vertically using position: relative, top: ; left ; etc
Added the header and footer, using <ul><li> positioned using ids on divs 
This was just to get familiar with placing elements on a page. Will go more in depth later.
